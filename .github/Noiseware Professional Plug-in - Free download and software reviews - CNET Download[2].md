On the right side, you will see four tabs: Noise Level, Noise Reduction, Detail Enhancement, and Advanced. Each tab has some sliders and options that you can adjust to fine-tune the noise reduction effect.
 
### Noise Level
 
This tab allows you to set the amount of noise that Noiseware Professional detects in your image. You can either use the Auto Profile button to let the plugin analyze your image and choose the optimal settings for you, or you can manually adjust the Luminance and Color sliders to increase or decrease the noise level.
 
Luminance noise is the grainy or speckled appearance of your image, while color noise is the random colored pixels that appear in your image. Usually, luminance noise is more noticeable and affects the sharpness of your image, while color noise affects the color accuracy and saturation of your image.
 
You can also choose a preset from the drop-down menu at the top, which offers some predefined settings for different types of images, such as Landscape, Night Scene, Portrait, etc.
 
### Noise Reduction
 
This tab allows you to control how much noise reduction is applied to your image. You can use the Strength slider to increase or decrease the overall intensity of the effect, or you can use the Luminance Detail and Color Detail sliders to preserve more or less details in your image.
 
Luminance Detail and Color Detail determine how much texture and contrast are retained in your image after applying noise reduction. If you set them too high, you may end up with an overly smooth or blurry image that lacks details. If you set them too low, you may end up with an overly noisy or grainy image that still has noise artifacts.
 
You can also choose a preset from the drop-down menu at the top, which offers some predefined settings for different levels of noise reduction, such as Default, Stronger, Weaker, etc.
 
### Detail Enhancement
 
This tab allows you to enhance some details in your image that may have been lost or softened by noise reduction. You can use the Sharpening slider to increase or decrease the sharpness of your image edges, or you can use the Contrast slider to increase or decrease the contrast of your image tones.
 
Sharpening and Contrast can help you restore some definition and clarity to your image after applying noise reduction. However, if you set them too high, you may end up with an overly sharp or contrasty image that looks unnatural or harsh. If you set them too low, you may end up with an overly soft or flat image that looks dull or washed out.
 
You can also choose a preset from the drop-down menu at the top, which offers some
