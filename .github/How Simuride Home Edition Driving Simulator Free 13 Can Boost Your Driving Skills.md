## What are the benefits of driving simulators for learning?
 
Driving simulators are not only fun and convenient, but also effective and beneficial for learning driving skills. According to research and experts, driving simulators can provide multiple benefits for learners, such as:

- Increased cost-savings and safety. Driving simulators can reduce the expenses and risks associated with using real vehicles for training. You don't have to pay for fuel, insurance, maintenance, or repairs. You also don't have to worry about damaging the vehicle or causing accidents in real life.[^1^]
- Training for critical and rare driving events. Driving simulators can expose you to situations that are difficult or dangerous to replicate in real life, such as tire blowouts, bad road conditions, or animals in the roadway. You can learn how to react to these events appropriately and avoid collisions.[^2^]
- Learning scenario programmability and versatility. Driving simulators can allow you to practice in different scenarios and environments that are relevant to your needs and goals. You can choose from different weather conditions, road hazards, traffic density, speed limit, and driving time. You can also customize your own scenarios and difficulty level.[^1^]
- Standardization of training programs. Driving simulators can ensure that all learners receive the same quality and consistency of training. You can follow a structured curriculum that covers all the essential driving skills and rules. You can also compare your performance with other learners using objective measures.[^1^]
- Increased ability to apply proven pedagogical principles. Driving simulators can facilitate the application of effective learning principles such as repetition, feedback, reinforcement, transfer, and retention. You can practice as much as you want until you master a skill. You can receive immediate and detailed feedback on your errors and speed. You can reinforce your learning by repeating the same scenario or trying a different one. You can transfer your skills from the simulator to the real vehicle. You can retain your skills by reviewing them periodically.[^1^]
- Enhanced control of the learning process. Driving simulators can give you more control over your own learning pace and style. You can learn at your own speed without pressure or distraction from other drivers or instructors. You can also choose your own learning objectives and preferences.[^1^]
- Higher quality feedback. Driving simulators can provide you with more accurate and comprehensive feedback than human instructors or observers. You can see your errors and speed on a report at the end of each drive. You can also review your performance on a replay mode that shows your view from inside and outside the vehicle.[^1^]
- Improved train-the-trainer programs. Driving simulators can help instructors improve their teaching skills and methods. They can use the simulator to demonstrate skills, monitor learners' progress, provide feedback, assess learners' performance, and design effective training programs.[^1^]
